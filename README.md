This is a simple one way control interface for _Pure Data_ from a QT application. It's a widget plug-in for _QT Creator IDE_.

It works with recent _QT Creator 1.x_ and _QT Designer_, but it is useless with the second.

## Get the source code, compile and run blank qpd canvas

Clone the repository on you machine:
                git clone git://github.com/errordeveloper/qpd.git
clone the sub-projects:
                cd qpd && git submodule update --init
or just do `make basic-example`. If the window pops-up - yahoo-oo, it works!
Use ^C to interrupt it and you can not do whatever you wish in `projects` directory.
I recoment creating a local branch (`cd projects/ ; git branch local ; git checkout local`).

See `TODO.md` for what needs to be done ...

Send questions and suggestions to `errordeveloper -at- g m a i l -dot- com` please!
