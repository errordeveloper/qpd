This is a simple one way control interface for Pure Data
from a QT application. It's a widget plugin for QT Creator IDE.

It works with recent QT Creator 1.x and QT Designer,
but it is useless with the Designer.

To compile go to  ./qpd_SockWidg_QtDesigner/
and use `qmake qpd_SockWidgPlugin.pro` then
`make && make install`
it will normally install into:
/usr/lib/qt4/plugins/designer/

there will be a library file and the source code directory,
where the header file is meant to be found.
this is convinient to do for me ATM.
later we will probably install a library and a header file
in /usr/lib/ and /usr/include/

you also want to append "/usr/lib/qt4/plugins/designer/"
to "/etc/ld.so.conf" file or LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable,
also some distributions use "/etc/ld.so.conf.d/"
to store extra library path for local use.

we should probably change this later ..
once it's been decided what's better place for the library,
and may be the plugin should be split ..suggestions welcome!

after you have installed it,
use `new.csh MY_FIRST_qpd_app` script and it should all work!
