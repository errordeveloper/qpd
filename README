This is a simple one way control interface for Pure Data
from a QT application. It's a widget plugin for QT Creator IDE.

It works with recent QT Creator 1.x and QT Designer,
but it is useless with the Designer.

To compile go to  ./qpd_SockWidg_QtDesigner/
and use `qmake qpd_SockWidgPlugin.pro` then
`make && make install`
it will normally install into:
/usr/lib/qt4/plugins/designer/

there will be a library file and the source code directory,
where the header file is meant to be found.
this is convinient to do for me ATM.
later we will probably install a library and a header file
in /usr/lib/ and /usr/include/

after you have installed it,
use `new.csh MY_FIRST_qpd_app` script and it should all work!

contact me if anything,
