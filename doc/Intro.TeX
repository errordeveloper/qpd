\part{Introduction}

{\emph{qpd} is an external GUI package for Pure Data.
It is primarly designed to be used with \emph{QTCreator IDE},
which allows simple GUI widget layout without any particular
knowledge of C++ and QT toolkit.}

{The Communication between PureData and qpd widgets takes place over
a TCP socket and does not ivolve any extra layers of abstraction,
such as OpenSoundControl or other.}
